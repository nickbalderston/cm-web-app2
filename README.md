# cm-web-app2

This web app allows users to submit a story to a database, and view stories that have been submitted.

To use this app, you can navigate to the folder in terminal and run node server.js

Then, in the browser, go to localhost:8080

The page should have links to a "tell story" page -that allows you to type and submit a story- and a "see stories" page that lists all stories within the database.
